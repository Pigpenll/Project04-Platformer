# Project Name
Project 4 2D Platformer - 3/16

I made an anger-inducing game in which you play as a little tomato navigating a dangerous world.

## Implementation
I included all of the features necessary for the first 15 points, as well as:

-Multiple levels!
-My own, custom made sprites for absolutely everything in the game.
-Sound effects
-Wall-jumping
-Whenever the character dies, they leave behind a tomato splat. Literally juicy...
